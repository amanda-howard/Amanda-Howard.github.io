I am a mathematician at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory located in Seattle, Washington. My research focuses on numerical methods for multiphase flows, including surface tension models for nanoscale flows and suspension flows, and scientific machine learning.

I received my PhD in 2018 from the [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.brown.edu) at Brown University, where I worked with Professor Martin Maxey.
