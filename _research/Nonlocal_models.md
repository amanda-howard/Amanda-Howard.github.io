title: "Nonlocal models for multiphase flow"

We propose a non-local model for surface tension obtained in the form of an integral of a molecular-force-like functionadded to the Navier-Stokes momentum conservation equation. The non-local surface tension model has an inherent length scale that can be tuned to model both macro-scale and nano-scale fluids. 

The non-local surface tension offers computational advantages over local surface tension models, because it relies on computing integrals instead of approximating a smoothed Dirac delta function, which can be present difficulties when the interface width is changing.
